# BlueREPL

**BlueREPL** is a command line tool to interact with BLE peripherals.

The goal of this project is to make the *ultimate* (for me at least) tool to debug and play with BLE peripherals.

It uses [SimpleBle](https://github.com/OpenBluetoothToolbox/SimpleBLE) under the hood and should work on **Windows**, **MacOS** and **Linux**.
